#  1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program? Give an example.
#  use the hashtag (#) sign
# comment example
#  2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all the following.
#  What are the outputs? If the output is an error record the error and try to determine what the error is!
a = 2
b = 5
print(b / a)
print(b // a)
print(b ** a)
print(b % a)
print(a + b)
print(type(42))
print(type(42.0))
print(type("C3PO"))
print(type(True))
#  3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines into the Python Console Window?
a = 2
a *= 10
a /= 2
a += 12
a -= 7
print(a)
print(type(a))
print(a)
print(type(a))
#  4.) What is the mistake in the following code. Fix it!
x, y = (4, 5)
a = (3 * x) + (3 * y)
print(a)
# had to state "print(a)" so that what A equals are going to be written
#  5.) What is the mistake in the following code, so it will calculate the average. Fix it!
x, y, z = (3, 4, 5)
ave = (x + y + z) / 3
print(ave)
